Install the heatset inserts as perpendicular as possible, it is critical to smooth motion of the final assembly. The spring prins should be the closest to the top.

Install the positioning screws from the same side as the heatserts.

The most difficult part - Pull the extension springs into the front half of the print, and install the pins through the loops. This is easier to do with forceps or needlenose pliers.
