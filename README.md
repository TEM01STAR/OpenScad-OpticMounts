# OpenScad-OpticMounts
This is a work in progress collection of 3d printable optic table mounts. They are written in OpenScad, not because I am good at using it, but because it is open source. The code will likely be messy, be warned.

Design intentions:
1 - Keep the cost low.
2 - Be compatible with existing optical setups where possible.
3 - Be as precise as possible without violating 1 and 2 ;)

Where possible, all hardware has been parameterized so the models can be tweaked to your preferences. The default models are using metric fasteners in sizes that work with the normal U.S. standard of 1 inch diameter optics and an optical bench consisting of 1/4-20 tapped holes on a 1 inch grid. Yes, this is cursed, but I prefer to stock metric fasteners.
